I'm a Ph.D. student at [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://cse.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), where I am conducting research in AI Security. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qian Wang](https://nisplab.whu.edu.cn/People.htm) of [NIS&P Lab](https://nisplab.whu.edu.cn/index.htm). My works primarily focus on adversarial robustness of AI systems, especially safety alignment and privacy in large language models. 

Previously, I received the B.E. degree in communication engineering from Shandong University in 2019 and the M.S. degree in electronic information from Wuhan University, China, in 2022.
